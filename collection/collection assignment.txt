collection assignment

ArrayList:

Internal structure: Dynamic array.

Access time: Fast O(1) for index access.

Insert/Delete: Slow O(n) in the middle.

Use case: When you need fast random access and mostly add elements at the end.

LinkedList:

Internal structure: Doubly linked list.

Access time: Slower O(n) for index access.

Insert/Delete: Fast O(1) at the beginning or end.

Use case: When you need fast insertions/deletions at the start or middle.

Summary: Use ArrayList for fast access and LinkedList for frequent insertions/removals.
